Domain Driven Design & Architecture â€“ Patterns ðŸ”Ž
Azure cloud hosted DDD & pattern-based architecture is highly scalable for the potentially large numbers of users around the world. Core domain sub domains identified, distilled further into bounded contexts which are then mapped to implementation patterns. Generic & Supporting domains are also identified and mapped to already implemented patterns. Besides the largely Tactical DDD, important elements of Strategic-DDD like CI/CD and upstream-downstream Context Mapping were identified. 
Infrastructure â€“ Shared IaC 
ï‚§	Your atypical AAD, Key Vault, Monitoring & Insights resources, shared resources like ACR, AAD B2C for custom identity management & Azure Search were also provisioned 
Fitness Mobile Application â€“ Xamarin
ï‚§	Support for indoor bike sessions, outdoor runs, indoor gym circuit training, indoor and outdoor bootcamps. Vital here is the proprietary tech developed for a real time view of multiple participant progress with custom map overlays and markers
ï‚§	UI build around Xamarin Forms with MVVMCross + lots of useful nuget packages with Skia Sharpnado doing some of the heavy lifting
ï‚§	iWatch & iOS IoT device sensor data streaming was managed by carefully developed low latency managers able to stream JSON to the cloud. Custom integration of IoT Edge BLE Smart Trainer with IoT Gateway such as iOS & Droid devices
Workout Data Streaming
ï‚§	IoT + Service Bus ðŸ”Ž Workout data is streamed live from sensors on IoT devices to Azure IoT hubs, routed via ASA to the correct Service Bus Topic based on the IoT device time zone, province and city 
ï‚§	Stream Analytics ðŸ”Ž Data from IoT hubs is routed to ASA for sensor data Anomaly detection and then queued to Service Bus Topics. Evaluated Kafka against Service Bus but decided to go with Service Bus
API Management â€“ AKS Microservices ðŸ”Ž
ï‚§	All our Functions are rolled out via containers running in an AKS cluster behind an internal load balancer. Azure API Gateway subnet is setup to resource provides routing, offloading and security management plus throttling & aggregation features for future needs
ï‚§	DrFit Microservices ðŸ”Žframework is all based around durable orchestrations and functions with minimal effort handling of any key vault secured and non-secured configuration information, storage, logging, extensions to the underlying IoC/DI AutoFac facilities
â€¢	Onboarding domain - Notifications, Device, Azure Resources Access keys/tokens, Role and Account Management
â€¢	Messaging domain â€“ Endpoints, Routing/Channels & Systems Management
â€¢	Front End Workout domain â€“ Workout Selection, Workout Tracking, Workout History, Workout Groups & more
ï‚§	Logic Apps
â€¢	Onboarding flows & more
DrFitAdmin â€“ App Services
ï‚§	Phase I, Node.js + React based Admin Application load balanced using Azure Front Door 
DrFitBot â€“ Bot Services ðŸ”Ž
ï‚§	Full Chatbot integration into the Xamarin app via the web chat channel required some challenging Xamarin side customizations
ï‚§	Azure Chatbot supported Virtual Trainer. In addition to QnA the Multi-turn Bot uses the Dispatch Tool for best match determination including from LUIS apps 
ï‚§	A more conversational style using the latest Bot Framework tech such as adaptive dialogs, LUIS, LG and skillbots is under development currently.

Fitness Guidance â€“ Databricks/Spark Machine Learning
ï‚§	WIP - Intelligent fitness training guidance via Azure ML models developed using collected health, motion and location data. The general idea is to test out these models with Spark + Power BI and then fold these models into the Chat Bot backend
DevOps
ï‚§	CI/CD pipelines are mostly built using the classic pipeline UI but later in the engagement resources like AKS clusters and Chat Bots are rolled out using Terraform and YAML builds & deployments
Testing
ï‚§	Built a WPF based Azure IoT/Azure Service Bus Explorer from scratch to monitor data streaming in real time
DR/HA
ï‚§	Chat Bot â€“ Provided by a full alternate provisioning in another Azure region and DNS load balancing via Azure Traffic Manager
ï‚§	API Management + Azure Functions on AKS - Provided by a full alternate provisioning in another Azure region and DNS load balancing via Azure Traffic Manager
ï‚§	Azure IoT â€“ In addition to the OOTB intra-region HA the plan is to leverage the Manual Failover provided by Azure at no extra cost with a periodic Manual Failover test
ï‚§	Azure Service Bus â€“ For now using partitioned service bus topics in the standard SKU. The plan for DR is to switch to the Premium SKU which supports primary-secondary namespace pairing via geo-replication with the existing namespace before the upgrade transparently becoming the paired alias for client connections
ï‚§	Stream Analytics â€“ Besides the OOTB SLA via MS geographically paired regions, additional options are TBD
ï‚§	Cosmos DB â€“ Accomplished by leveraging the OOTB multiple region replication support by associating multiple regions with the global Cosmos DB resource and connecting with multi-master mode enabled
ï‚§	Web Apps in App Services â€“ Azure Front Door is ideal for HTTP level routing with global failover. There have been some discussions about load balancing Azure API Management via AFD but no final plan yet
